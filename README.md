## Scoring System

### Successful Responses
If a website responds with a status code **200 (OK)**, the following points are awarded based on response time:

| Response Time         | Points Awarded |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| Less than 5 seconds   | +5 points      |
| 5-10 seconds          | +4 points      |
| 10-15 seconds         | +3 points      |
| 15-20 seconds         | +2 points      |
| 20-30 seconds         | +1 point       |

### Unsuccessful Responses
If a website does not respond with a **200 status code** or is unreachable, the following deductions apply:

| Condition            | Points Deducted |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| Non-200 response     | -1 point        |
| No response          | -1 point        |
| Site unreachable     | -2 points       |
